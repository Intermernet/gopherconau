By showing that GopherCon Australia is a welcoming conference, we wish to create a sense of community coming from different backgrounds, supporting traditionally underrepresented groups in the technology industry. We invited prominent contributors to the Go tech scene, who share and represent our vision of inclusion and who come from diverse gender and ethnicity groups.</span>

    <p class="speakers-bio"><p>I&#39;ve been an avid Gopher since 2012 - roughly as long as I&#39;ve been living in New Zealand. I discovered such an immediate productivity boost, that I haven&#39;t looked back from Go, or NZ, since. I helped start the Go Auckland meetup group in 2013, and I&#39;ve hosted and spoken at many meetups since then.</p> <p>About four years ago, a wise man persuaded me that &quot;setting up a new stack is the right time to begin CD&quot;. I claimed I was too busy getting product and platform to market, but he won me over: &quot;it&#39;s much harder to add CD later&quot;. I went with it, and I was so chuffed with the results that I&#39;ve been championing CD-related approaches ever since.</p></p>
