              <h5 class="has-text-centered">Description</h5>
              <p>This class has been designed over the past several years and goes beyond just being a Go service class. There will be very little time spent on specifc Go syntax. Our time will be spent learning how to re-engineer a web service and talk about application design, semantics and guidelines for building services in Go.</p>
              <p>Building Production Web Services In Go</p>
              <p>• Start/Stop</p>
              <p>• Logging/Configuration</p>
              <p>• Web Framework Design</p>
              <p>• Database Support</p>
              <p>• Testing</p>

              <ul>
                <li>A basic understanding of the Go programming language. Students do not have to be expert Go users but they will get the most from the workshop if they have completed the majority of the Go Tour.</li>

              <ul class="with-bullets">
                <p>Everyone is going to be mentally exhausted by the end of the day. We will be challenging every student to think about what they are doing and why. In the 4 years we have taught this material, we never had someone not appreciate the class and feel like they are a better developer for it. If you want to be a better Go developer, code reviewer, designer and architect, this is the class you want to take.</p>

              <h5 class="has-text-centered">Description</h5>
              <p>This workshop is for team leads, agile coaches and senior developers.</p>
              <p>The main goal is to workshop approaches to the biggest issue in software engineering; too much unverifiable code and not nearly enough human scale formal specifications.</p>
              <p>It covers topics from developer productivity to capturing system semantics. Using enterprise-ready features of Go 1.13 to advanced uses of protocol buffers.This is a hands on workshop, programming experience required, but experience with Go is not necessary.</p>
              <p>We will be using a combination of pairs and mob programming (pairs of mobs) to refactor and add features to a synthetic code base.</p>
              <p>Expect digressions into development process and economics of software engineering.</p>
